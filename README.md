# Database-of-Protein-Sequence-in-Autism

Building a database of Protein structure that leads to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Genomic sequence encodes the formation of protein structure. Here we are comparing the protein structure of  ASD risk genes with wild-type alleles from general population data (gnomAD) with alternative alleles. By studying the two structures, we will be able to find out the protein structures that contribute to ASD in offspring.
